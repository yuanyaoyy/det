#### Original text

when it comes to the opportunity for students to travelling abroad for study offered by their universities different people have different opinions some people hold the view that is a bad chance because most of the students cannot live in another city by themselves maybe they will face a lot of struggles or traffic bad things on the contrary i personally believe that it's a wonderful chance for traveling abroad for study let me explain more about my opinions when we study in alone in our self country we face the same people and cannot expand our horizons and especially our language skills for example english skills cannot be improved on the contrary when we study abroad we can face the other countries people and speak to them day by day then our language skills will be improved as soon as possible i also want to share my own experiences about study when i was in high high school i had a chance to study in another city not another country but i was also gain a lot of knowledges from that experience i talk to their my new classmates and new teachers learn their cultures and communicate with them with my calm towns cultures overall i believe that study abroad is a good opportunity for everyone there are only little drawbacks but it can be ignored so if you have a chance to study in another country jessica you'll you'll be thankful for this experience
