## Question
If you had the chance to travel to a new area, which type of tour would you go for, cultural tours, nature tours, or shopping tours? Have you had such an experience yet? Use personal experiences as examples to support your view

## sample
when it comes to choosing the type of tour for traveling to a new area, people tend to hold distinctive and sometimes contrasting perspectives. Some individuals are fascinated by cultural tours, others are attracted to shopping trips, while a different group strongly prefers nature-based experiences. As for me, I firmly favor nature tours.

The primary reason is that natural scenery has a unique power to calm my mind and enrich my inner world. Surrounded by forests, mountains, and the sea, I feel a deep sense of peace that is difficult to experience in crowded shopping centers or museums. Nature allows me to slow down, reflect, and reconnect with myself on a deeper level.

This preference was not always the case, and my personal experience clearly illustrates this shift. In the past, I used to dislike natural landscapes because I assumed they were ordinary and could be seen anywhere in the world. As a result, whenever I had the opportunity to travel, I usually chose shopping-oriented trips instead. However, everything changed when my wife and I visited Zhangjiajie, a famous scenic destination in China. I was truly amazed by the towering mountains rising into the sky and the endless green forests stretching as far as the eye could see. The entire landscape felt breathtaking and unlike anything I had ever encountered before. In addition, the tourists were friendly, and the local staff were incredibly helpful, which made the experience even more memorable.

overall, this journey completely transformed my attitude toward traveling. Nowadays, I actively choose nature tours whenever possible, and if given the chance, I hope to travel around the world to explore more natural wonders. These experiences not only relax me but also enrich my spirit and help me become a better person.
